# NLTK Text Summarizer Streamlit App

## Description

The NLTK Text Summarizer is a Streamlit web application designed to summarize text using natural language processing techniques. Leveraging the power of the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), the app analyzes the input text to identify key points and generate a concise summary. Users can adjust the length of the summary by specifying the desired number of sentences. This tool is particularly useful for quickly grasping the main ideas of longer texts, including articles, reports, and essays.
